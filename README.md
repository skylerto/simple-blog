# Simple Blog

A simple blogging application I made to experiment with devise user permissions, and
dashboards. 

Supports multiple user logins, blog post, and post comments.


## Usage
Clone, install, run.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/skylerto/simple-blog.git
$ cd simple-blog; bundle install
$ rails s
```

This app is also deployed on Heroku, if you'd like the URL send me an email!

## Progress

Looking to split this into a rails engine as this app is also part of a larger application, The Gypsy Corner.
